# Data Science Projects

Hello! This is a simple repository to show some projects which I created while studying *Data Science and Big Data topics*.

### Big Data with Spark
That folder contains Jupyter Notebooks which I created while doing the [course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+DSE230x+1T2018/course/) from UC San Diego.

That course covers data manipulation using **Apache Spark Resilient Distributed Datasets and Data Frames using Python**, including data visualization and machine learning techniques as **K-Means, Decision Trees and Neural Networks.**
